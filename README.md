# CausalDataAugmentation
This is modified causal data augmentation code from Teshima（2021）, mainly to address the problem that the sample size would suffer exponential increase when running the algorithm.

I separate the data augmentation procedure and causal weight calculation so that I do not have to repeat the data along columns.
